      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This pandan waffle recipe takes it up a notch (and in a Vietnamese / southeast Asian direction) with its sweet aroma of pandan, rich coconutty taste, chewy mochi center, and a crispy outer texture. </p>

      <p>If you can source pandan leaves, either frozen or fresh, the aroma will be amazing. Plus the batter keeps for up to a week in the fridge so you can enjoy fresh baked waffles throughout the week!</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 drops artificial pandan extract</li>
          <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
          <li>2 cup tapioca starch</li>
          <li>1/2 cup rice flour</li>
          <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup sugar</li>
          <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>13.5 fl oz coconut cream</li>
          <li>1 tbs neutral cooking oil</li>
          <li>1 cup shredded coconut (optional) </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add artifical extract to water and set aside for later.</li>
          <li>In a medium mixing bowl, add the tapioca starch, rice flour, all purpose flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</li>
          <li>In another large mixing bowl, beat the eggs together. Then, add the coconut cream, pandan extract and oil.</li>
          <li>Sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients mixing bowl. Add the shredded coconut if you want. Fold carefully to prevent from over-mixing the batter. Your batter should be slightly thick and have lumps leftover. If you're using artifical pandan extract and want the batter to be more green, at this point, you can add 1-2 more drops and mix the batter again.</li>
          <li>Let the batter rest for at least one hour. This improves the dough's texture. If you're only resting it for an hour, leaving it on the counter should be fine. If not, you can put the batter in an air-tight container and leave it in the fridge. The batter will still be good up to a week.</li>
          <li> When ready to cook, mix the batter slightly. Heat up your waffle iron to medium high. Do this before making EACH waffle as to let the batter separate and settle.</li>
          <li>Depending on your ladle, fill the iron until it's 1/5 from the edge. Close the waffle iron and let it cook. Once finish, the outside should be golden and crispy while the inside should be green and spongey.</li>
          <li>Remove your waffle and serve. If you find your waffle to be slightly on the softer side, let it rest for a minute or two. It should be crispier once cooled.</li>
      </ol>
