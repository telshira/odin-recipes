      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A staple of the Vietnamese community, the eggroll can be a delicious snack or part of a meal. These deep-fried goodies are traditionally made with rice paper sheets (bánh tráng), but are very commonly made with wheat-based wrappers. The eggrolls can be made from pork, chicken, turkey, shrimp or even just tofu and veggies. Whether you're a meatlover or a vegetarian, the eggroll fillings can be catered to your taste. Below we're going to create a simple pork and veggies egrolls. You can replace the pork or take it out altogether or exchange it for other veggies like carrots or mushrooms.</p>
